Before you get started, you should discuss with your team and instructor the
following vocab words: Git, GitHub, version control, and repository.

1. Download and install VS Code (If you prefer a different app for typing up
your code, eventually you will be able to use that, but you should see what 
VS Code can do)

2. On a web browser, go to github.com and create a user account (make sure to 
complete the process by verifying your email!)

2. Download and install the GitHub Desktop app; sign in using your GitHub account
	
3. You still have to separately install Git itself. In GitHub Desktop, do this:
	– Windows: Under the "Repository" menu, select "Open in Command Line"
	– Mac: Under the "Repository" menu, select "Open in Terminal"
		Under "GitHub Desktop" menu, select "Install Command Line Tool ..."

4. On a web browser, go to <Git lesson repository URL>.
 
 * In the list of files, click on "1_Worksheet.txt." It should show 
   you a text file with the header "Git Training Worksheet" in the 
   browser window.
 
 * On the right side of the box showing the text in the file, click 
   on the pencil icon. It should create a fork (your own separate 
   copy of the repository).

 * You should now be viewing your own copy of the worksheet. You will
   work on it both on the website and on your computer, but finish
   the instructions below before you start filling in answers.

5. Go into GitHub Desktop. Select the option to clone a repository from the
   internet. You should see a list of your repositories, and you should be able
   to select one that says "<Your username>/git_training"
