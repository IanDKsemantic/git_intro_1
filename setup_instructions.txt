Before you get started, you should discuss with your team and 
instructor the following terms: Git, GitHub, version control, 
repository, remote repository, and local repository.

Useful resource: https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/

1. Download and install VS Code (If you prefer a different app for 
   typing up your code, you will have the option to use that later.)

2. On a web browser, go to github.com and create a user account 
   (make sure to complete the process by verifying your email!)

2. Download, install, and sign into GitHub Desktop
	
3. You still have to separately install Git itself. In GitHub 
   Desktop, do the following:
 * Windows: Under the "Repository" menu, select "Open in 
    Command Line"
 * Mac: Under the "Repository" menu, select "Open in Terminal." 
    Then, under "GitHub Desktop" menu, select "Install Command 
    Line Tool ..."

4. On a web browser, go to <Git lesson repository URL>.
 
 * In the list of files, click on "1_worksheet.txt." It should show 
   you a text file with the header "GIT PRACTICE WORKSHEET."
 
 * On the right side of the box showing the text in the file, click 
   on the pencil icon. It should create a fork (your own separate 
   copy of the repository).

 * You should now see your own copy of the worksheet, part of your
   own online copy of the repository.

5. Go into GitHub Desktop. Select the option to clone a repository 
   from the internet, which will create your local repository.
   
   * You should see a list of your repositories; select the one 
     listed as "<Your username>/git_training"

   * Finish the process of creating a local repository on your 
     computer, and take note of where the files are being saved.
  
   * In the lefthand column, select the "git_training" repository. 
     In the main window, choose "Open in Visual Studio Code."

6. You should now be in VS Code, and it will show you a list of the
   files in the repository in the lefthand column. Select 
   "1_workshee.txt" and start following the instructions in there.
   Good luck and have fun!
