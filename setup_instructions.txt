Before you get started, you should discuss with your team and 
instructor the following terms: Git, GitHub, version control, 
and repository. 

Useful resource: https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/

1. Download and install VS Code (If you prefer a different app for 
typing up your code, eventually you will be able to use that, but 
you should see what VS Code can do)

2. On a web browser, go to github.com and create a user account 
(make sure to complete the process by verifying your email!)

2. Download and install the GitHub Desktop app; sign in using your 
GitHub account
	
3. You still have to separately install Git itself. In GitHub 
Desktop, do the following:
  * Windows: Under the "Repository" menu, select "Open in 
    Command Line"
  * Mac: Under the "Repository" menu, select "Open in Terminal." 
    Then, under "GitHub Desktop" menu, select "Install Command 
    Line Tool ..."

4. On a web browser, go to <Git lesson repository URL>.
 
 * In the list of files, click on "1_worksheet.txt." It should show 
   you a text file with the header "Git Training Worksheet" in the 
   browser window.
 
 * On the right side of the box showing the text in the file, click 
   on the pencil icon. It should create a fork (your own separate 
   copy of the repository).

 * You should now be viewing your own copy of the worksheet, which is 
   a part of your own separate copy of the repository. But for now,
   your copy of the repository still only exists online. 

5. Go into GitHub Desktop. Select the option to clone a repository 
   from the internet. 
   
   * You should see a list of your repositories; select the one 
     listed as "<Your username>/git_training"

   * Finish the process of creating a local repository on your 
     computer, and take note of where the files are being saved.
