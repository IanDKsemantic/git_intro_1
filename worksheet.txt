GIT PRACTICE WORKSHEET

(If you haven't already gone through the steps in "setup_instructions.txt,"
you should do those first)

To learn about using Git, we're going to do something that should be familar
from school: fill out a worksheet.  

As you go through and answer questions, think about the separate places that your
changes (answers) get recorded: the file on your computer, your local Git 
repository, and your remote Git repository. Any work you do has to get to that
last stop if it's going to be used by your team.

Answer the question below in the space provided, then save the file.

   1. WHAT DID YOU LAST HAVE FOR LUNCH?

   ANSWER 1: 

Take a look at the file in your GitHub web browser window. Notice that your changes 
have not yet shown up here.  

Now look in GitHub Desktop.

You will need to do 2 things to get your changes into the online repository. 
  A) You will need to COMMIT the changes, which officially "saves" them in your 
     local repository.  Do this by pushing the blue button in the lower right corner.
  B) You will need to PUSH the changes, which applies changes from any commits to the 
     remote repository.  Do that, then confirm in your web browser that the file has 
     changed online.

Talk with your teammates about the possible reasons this process was set up with its 
multple steps.

   2. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE?

   ANSWER 2: 

Repeat the process from above, but this time make sure to add a MESSAGE in each step 
explaining the changes that were made.  (Look in the lower left corner in GitHub
Desktop.)

After you've done that, look at the web browser view of Git.  Click on the "Code" 
tab to see the overall repository, then click on "Commits" to see the history of
of commits that have been made.

Talk with your teammates about why this could be helpful and why including messages
with commits is important.
