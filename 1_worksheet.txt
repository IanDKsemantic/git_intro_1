GIT PRACTICE WORKSHEET

(If you haven't already gone through the steps in "setup_instructions.txt,"
you should do those first)

To learn about using Git, we're going to do something that should be familar
from school: fill out a worksheet.  

As you go through and answer questions, think about the separate places that your
changes (answers) get recorded: the file on your computer, your local Git 
repository, and your remote Git repository. Any work you do has to get to that
last stop if it's going to be used by your team.

   1. WHAT DID YOU LAST HAVE FOR LUNCH?

   ANSWER 1: 

Take a look at the file in your GitHub web browser window. Notice that your changes 
have not yet shown up here.  

Now look in GitHub Desktop.  Discuss with your teammates what you are being shown 
there.

You will need to do 2 things to get your changes into the online repository. 
  A) You will need to COMMIT the changes, which officially "saves" them in your 
     local repository.  Do this by pushing the blue button in the lower right corner.
  B) You will need to PUSH the changes, which applies changes from any commits to the 
     remote repository.  Do that, then confirm in your web browser that the file has 
     changed online.
